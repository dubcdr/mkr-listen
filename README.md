# Uniswap Listen

Personal project (for now) to create a rust cli to listen to Uniswap and see some summary data.

This is how I'll learn Rust and Blockchain Development

## Future Work

- [x] Parrelism using [rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon)
- [ ] Secret Management - use cli keys from env file
- [ ] Better [project structure](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules.html)
- [ ] Transaction type router (before decryption)
- [ ] More transaction types
- [ ] Better logging
- [ ] Testing &#128584;&#128584;&#128584;
- [ ] Integrate [token-list](https://github.com/telcoin/token-list)
- [ ] Cli Options :: filter_token, filter_threshold, time_machine

## Strech

- [ ] Advanced Terminal Interface :: [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) or [tui](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs)
- [ ] Pending Transaction Pool
